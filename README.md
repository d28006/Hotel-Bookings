🏨 Hotel Revenue Performance Dashboard: Multi-Year Insights on Revenue, Occupancy, and Parking Demand
An interactive Power BI dashboard designed to track hotel revenue trends, customer demand, and operational KPIs across different hotel types (City vs Resort) and time periods—empowering data-driven decisions in hospitality management.

2. Short Description / Purpose

The Hotel Revenue Performance Dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of key hospitality metrics including revenue, average daily rate (ADR), occupancy demand (nights booked), discounts, and parking requirements. It enables hotel managers, revenue analysts, and executives to monitor trends, compare performance across hotel types, and identify opportunities for revenue optimization and operational efficiency.

3. Tech Stack

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

• 📊 Power BI Desktop – Main platform for building the visual report and storytelling
• 🔄 Power Query (M) – For extracting, cleaning, and transforming raw hotel booking data
• 🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – For dynamic measures such as revenue, ADR, discount %, and car space calculations
• 🧩 Data Modeling – Structured relationships between booking records, hotel types, and yearly aggregates
• 🗄 SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) – For creating and managing the relational database environment before loading into Power BI
• 💻 SQL (SELECT, JOIN, UNION, aggregation functions) – Used to query, combine, and aggregate multi-year booking data prior to visualization
• 📁 File Format – .pbix (Power BI project) with exported images for sharing

4. Data Source
